# Odin Recipes

This is the first project of [The Odin Project Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).

The goal of this project is to consolidate basic knowledge of HTML by building a simple recipe website. It focuses solely on HTML to strengthen foundational skills.

The **Odin Recipes** project involves creating:
- A main **index** page that acts as the central hub.
- Multiple individual recipe pages, each linked from the index page.
- Well-structured content using semantic HTML to organize text, images, and lists.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Structure a multi-page website using semantic HTML.  
- Create and manage links between different pages.  
- Use proper HTML tags to format content such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.

This project serves as an important stepping stone on a journey to becoming a web developer.
